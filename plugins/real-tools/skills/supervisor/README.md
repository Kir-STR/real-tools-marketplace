# Supervisor Skill

The Supervisor orchestrates complex, multi-step projects through a structured, resumable workflow with specialized worker agents.

## Overview

The supervisor implements a **supervisor-worker pattern** where:
- **Supervisor** manages the workflow, coordinates agents, and handles state
- **Workers** are specialized agents that perform specific tasks

## Workflow

The supervisor executes a **14-step workflow** across **4 phases** with two human-in-the-loop (HIL) approval gates:

### Phase 1: Initialization
Check for existing session and initialize or resume workflow.

### Phase 2: Planning & Specification
Analyze PRD, create execution plan, generate specification schema, critique and iterate until plan approval (**HIL Gate 1**), then generate detailed specification and create initial checkpoint.

### Phase 3: Draft Creation & Review
Create draft deliverable, collect user feedback (**HIL Gate 2**), and create draft checkpoint.

### Phase 4: Final Delivery
Create final deliverable incorporating feedback and archive session.

**Note:** For detailed step-by-step implementation instructions, see SKILL.md.

## Worker Agents

The supervisor delegates tasks to **6 custom agents** plus built-in Claude Code agents:

**Custom Agents:**
- **Analyst** - Requirements analysis and specification generation
- **Designer** - UI/UX designs, architecture diagrams, system design
- **Implementer** - Code implementation and technical development
- **Writer** - Documentation, technical writing, content creation
- **Critique** - Critical review and constructive feedback
- **Tester** - Testing strategies, test cases, quality assurance

**Built-in Agents:**
- **Explore** - PRD analysis and requirements extraction
- **Plan** - Planning and task breakdown

The supervisor selects the appropriate agent based on deliverable type and task description.

## State Management

All session state is stored in `.supervisor/`:

```
.supervisor/
├── state.json                    # Current workflow state
├── session_log.json              # Complete agent execution log
└── output/
    ├── exploration_report.md     # Step 3
    ├── plan.md                   # Step 4
    ├── spec_schema.md            # Step 5
    ├── plan_critique.md          # Step 6
    ├── task_spec.md              # Step 8
    ├── draft_[type].[ext]        # Step 10
    ├── feedback.md               # Step 11 (if provided)
    └── final_[type].[ext]        # Step 13
```

### state.json Structure

```json
{
  "session_id": "timestamp-based-id",
  "current_phase": "phase_name",
  "current_step": 1,
  "prd_path": "path/to/prd.md",
  "artifacts": {
    "prd": "path/to/prd.md",
    "exploration_report": ".supervisor/output/exploration_report.md",
    "plan": ".supervisor/output/plan.md",
    "spec_schema": ".supervisor/output/spec_schema.md",
    "task_spec": ".supervisor/output/task_spec.md",
    "draft": ".supervisor/output/draft_*.ext",
    "feedback": ".supervisor/output/feedback.md",
    "final": ".supervisor/output/final_*.ext"
  },
  "checkpoints": {
    "initial": 9,
    "draft": 12
  },
  "completed_steps": [1, 2, 3, ...]
}
```

### Output Naming Convention

Output filenames are derived from your PRD filename by stripping the path and extension:

- `api_requirements.md` → `draft_api.*`, `final_api.*`
- `system_design.md` → `draft_system_design.*`, `final_system_design.*`
- `docs/user_guide.md` → `draft_user_guide.*`, `final_user_guide.*`

The file extension (`.js`, `.py`, `.md`, etc.) is determined by the deliverable type specified in your PRD.

## Resumption

If a session is interrupted, simply re-run the command:

```bash
/real-tools:supervisor path/to/prd.md
```

The supervisor:
1. Detects existing `state.json`
2. Reads the last completed step
3. Asks if you want to resume or start fresh
4. If resuming, continues from the next step

## Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) Gates

Two mandatory approval points:

### HIL Gate 1: Plan Approval (Step 7)
Review and approve the execution plan before work begins.

**Options:**
- **Approve** → Continue to specification
- **Request Changes** → Provide feedback, plan is revised, re-presented
- **Cancel** → Abort the task

### HIL Gate 2: Draft Review (Step 11)
Review the draft deliverable and provide feedback.

**Options:**
- **Approve** → Continue to final version (feedback: "approved")
- **Provide Feedback** → Save feedback, incorporated in final version
- **Reject** → Return to draft creation with rejection reasons

## Checkpoints

Two checkpoints enable safe rollback via `/rewind`:

1. **Initial Checkpoint (Step 9)** - Before draft creation
   - Use to change the specification or approach

2. **Draft Checkpoint (Step 12)** - Before final execution
   - Use to revise based on different feedback

## PRD Requirements

Your PRD should clearly define what you want to build. See [examples.md](./examples.md) for complete PRD examples and templates.

## Usage Examples

For examples including system design, documentation, resumption patterns, and complex scenarios, see [examples.md](./examples.md).

## Error Handling

If any step fails:
1. Error is logged in `session_log.json` with `status: "failed"`
2. Workflow does NOT advance to next step
3. You are notified of the failure
4. Options: Retry step, Modify inputs, or Cancel

## Advanced Usage

### Modifying the Specification Schema

If the default schema doesn't fit your needs, you can provide a custom schema:

1. Create your own `custom_schema.md`
2. Reference it in your PRD under a "Specification Schema" section
3. The supervisor will use your custom schema instead

### Providing Early Feedback

At the plan approval stage (Step 7), you can:
- **Approve** the plan as-is to proceed
- **Request specific changes** to the plan
- **Cancel** if the approach isn't suitable

This ensures you're aligned with the approach before implementation begins.

### Iterating on Drafts

At the draft review stage (Step 11), you can:
- **Approve** the draft and proceed to final version
- **Provide detailed feedback** for improvements
- **Reject** the draft and request a complete redo

Your feedback is saved to `feedback.md` and incorporated into the final version.

### Working with Large Projects

For complex projects:
1. Break the PRD into phases if needed
2. Use checkpoints to iterate on specific parts
3. Review `session_log.json` to understand agent decisions
4. Use `/rewind` to try different approaches

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No PRD file found at path"

**Solution**: Ensure the PRD file path is correct and the file exists.

```bash
# Check if file exists
ls path/to/prd.md

# Use absolute path if needed
/real-tools:supervisor /full/path/to/prd.md
```

### Issue: Agent fails during execution

**Solution**: The supervisor will log the error and ask if you want to retry, modify inputs, or cancel. Check the session log for details:

```bash
# View session log
cat .supervisor/session_log.json

# Look for entries with "status": "failed"
```

### Issue: Can't resume previous session

**Solution**: Ensure `.supervisor/state.json` exists. If corrupted:

```bash
# Check if state file exists
ls .supervisor/state.json

# If corrupted, delete and start fresh
rm -rf .supervisor/
/real-tools:supervisor path/to/prd.md
```

### Issue: Final deliverable doesn't match expectations

**Solution**: Use `/rewind` to return to the draft checkpoint, provide more detailed feedback, and regenerate the final version.

```bash
# Rewind to draft checkpoint
/rewind
# Select "Draft Checkpoint"
# Workflow resumes at draft review (Step 11)
# Provide detailed, specific feedback
# Final version regenerated with new feedback
```

### Issue: Workflow stuck at approval gate

**Solution**: The supervisor is waiting for your input. Respond to the approval prompt to continue.

### Issue: State file shows wrong step

**Solution**: The state file may be corrupted. You can either:
1. Delete `.supervisor/` and start fresh
2. Manually edit `.supervisor/state.json` to correct the step (advanced)

## Best Practices

1. **Write detailed PRDs** - Better requirements lead to better results
2. **Review plans carefully** at HIL Gate 1 - This is your chance to shape the approach
3. **Provide specific feedback** during draft review - Be explicit about what needs to change
4. **Use `/rewind`** liberally - Don't hesitate to go back to checkpoints
5. **Check `session_log.json`** for complete audit trail of all agent activity
6. **Organize PRDs** in a dedicated directory for easy management
7. **Be specific in deliverable requirements** - Clearly state what format and content you expect

## Limitations

The supervisor explicitly avoids work not required by the PRD:
- Won't create extensive documentation beyond specifications unless requested
- Won't perform complex analytics unless specified in PRD
- Won't create deployment pipelines or CI/CD unless included in deliverable requirements
- Won't create automated test suites unless explicitly required in PRD

**Focus**: Core task execution from PRD to deliverable as specified.

## Components

The Supervisor skill consists of:

- **SKILL.md** - Core supervisor instructions for Claude Code
- **examples.md** - Usage examples, common patterns, and structure examples
- **README.md** - This file (skill documentation for users)

Worker agents are defined in `../../agents/` directory (7 specialized agents).

## Architecture

The supervisor implements these principles:

1. **File-Based Operations** - All inputs/outputs are files for transparency and version control
2. **Supervisor Pattern** - Decompose complex tasks, delegate to specialists, aggregate results
3. **Spec-Driven Communication** - Structured schemas ensure reliable agent handoffs
4. **State Persistence** - Robust state management enables resumption after interruptions
5. **Human-in-the-Loop** - User approval at critical decision points (plan approval, draft review)
6. **Checkpointing** - Integration with `/rewind` for safe rollback to known states
